    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>

      <li>1 large egg</li>

      <li>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs</li>

      <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>

      <li>8 chicken tenders</li>

      <li>freshly chopped parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather Ingredients</li>
      <li>
        Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat basket with
        cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk egg in a small bowl. In another bowl, stir together panko and oil
        until loose and crumbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip each chicken tender into egg, allowing excess to drip off. Dip
        chicken in panko mixture to coat completely. Working in batches if
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange chicken in an even layer in the air fryer basket. Cook until
        chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about
        12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
        read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot garnished with freshly chopped parsley. Enjoy!</li>

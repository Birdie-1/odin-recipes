    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This roasted chicken recipe is a classic dish that is perfect for family
      dinners or special occasions. The chicken is seasoned with a blend of
      herbs and spices, then roasted to perfection, resulting in a crispy skin
      and juicy meat.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>

      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cloves</li>

      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground allspice</li>

      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>

      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>

      <li>1 (4 pound) whole chicken</li>

      <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix salt, sugar, cloves, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a
        small bowl until combined. Rub chicken all over with spice mixture.
        Transfer chicken to a large bowl, cover, and refrigerate for 24 hours.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Place chicken, breast-side down, on a rack in a roasting pan. Stuff
        chicken cavity with crushed garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast chicken in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 450
        degrees F (230 degrees C) and continue roasting for 15 minutes more.
        Baste chicken with pan drippings; reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220
        degrees C) and continue roasting for 30 minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone,
        should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and allow to rest in a warm area for 20 minutes
        before slicing.
      </li>
    </ol>
